# asystant-ai
2 AI models at once, Gemini as LLM and Moondream as VLM.

# How it works
Its just a project for testing.

You enter a prompt, Gemini answers normally except its something about seeing something.

If it is, Gemini activates Moondream and a screenshot from your webcam and your prompt goes to Moondream and you get a response about current image.

# Setup
Webcam system works for Google Colab. So we should use Colab for this.

1. Clone the repo
2. [Open Colab and import asystant-ai.ipynb](https://colab.google/)
3. Change the API keys as yours. (For both Moondream and Gemini.)
4. Run scripts in order (install dependencies and run the main code)
5. Done!

# What is this?
I made this just for testing this concept. You can feel free to use it and do more things with this method.

Basically, a LLM calls other models by saying a spesific word. You can use it like this example, chatting with both LLM and VLM models.
